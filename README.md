This is the library website i made, which uses XAMPP, phpMyAdmin, HTML & CSS, SQL and PHP programming language to create a completely functional library website.
This website uses phpMyAdmin and XAMPP as a backend to create tables with data in them. Using PHP and SQL Queries, i created a fully desgined website with functionality such as:
User login, user registration, book searching with specific criteria, view reserved books, reserve booksand delete reserved books.
This website used PHP sessions to ensure it couldnt be bypassed via URL.
This website was hosted using a local host, however I have commited the full assignment debrief of how the website looks using all functionality.
